# Point-Cloud-Interpolation
Compared to the high frame rates of other sensors used in vehicles, LIDAR has a low frame rate, averaging around 20Hz, which adversely affects tasks such as multi-sensor fusion and target tracking. Although there have been many methods for video frame interpolation, they do not migrate efficiently due to the disordered nature of the point cloud data. The aim of this work is to develop a method for frame interpolation of LiDAR point cloud data through a deep learning approach. This work successfully improved the interpolation accuracy by about 20% over current SOTA methods.
